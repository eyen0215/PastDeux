# PastDue
Have you ever struggled with deadlines or just are always late, despite having schedules, calendars, and reminders? We did too. Which is why we had the idea to try a different strategy. PastDue is a web application that leverages fear and negative reinforcement to get you to start doing your work early. Instead of reminding you when things are about to be due, it only reminds you when things have become past due. This may seem counterintuitive, but in fact it helps you do your work early and develop a healthy mental calendar without the reliance on a billion scheduling apps.

## Technologies We Used

### Frontend:
- HTML and Flask for a responsive user interface
- Tailwind for efficient, dynamic styling

### Backend:
- Python for server-side logic
- OPENAI for generating personalized emails
- SMTL for sending email reminders
- Firebase for storing login credentials as well as calendar and todolist states
- Google Cloud Platform for hosting the website 24/7
